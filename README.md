# React Hooks in Svelte

A SvelteKit website showing side-by-side examples of React hooks and the equivalent Svelte code.

The code examples are 100% made by [Josh Nuss](https://github.com/joshnuss) with [React Hooks in Svelte](https://github.com/joshnuss/react-hooks-in-svelte). All I've done is dress them up visually, so I could play around with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and [Skeleton UI](https://www.skeleton.dev/).

## Developing

Once you've installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
